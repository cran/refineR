Description: Indirect method for the estimation of reference intervals using 
	Real-World Data ('RWD'). It takes routine measurements of diagnostic 
	tests, containing pathological and non-pathological samples as input 
	and uses sophisticated statistical methods to derive a model describing 
	the distribution of the non-pathological samples. This distribution can 
	then be used to derive reference intervals. Furthermore, the package 
	offers functions for printing and plotting the results of the algorithm. 
	See ?refineR for a more comprehensive description of the features. 
	Version 1.0 of the algorithm is described in detail in 'Ammer et al. (2021)' 
	<doi:10.1038/s41598-021-95301-2>. Additional guidance on the usage of 
	the algorithm is given in 'Ammer et al. (2023)' <doi:10.1093/jalm/jfac101>.
