Description: Indirect method for the estimation of reference intervals using Real-World Data ('RWD'). It takes routine measurements 
	of diagnostic tests, containing pathological and non-pathological samples as input and uses sophisticated
	statistical methods to derive a model describing the distribution of the non-pathological samples. This distribution can then be 
	used to derive reference intervals. 
	Furthermore, the package offers functions for printing and plotting the results of the algorithm. 
	The method is described in detail in Ammer T., Schuetzenmeister A., Prokosch H.-U., Rauh M., Rank C.M., Zierk J. "refineR: A Novel Algorithm for Reference Interval Estimation from Real-World Data". Scientific Reports (2021) [accepted July 21, 2021].
