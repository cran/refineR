Description: Indirect method for the estimation of reference intervals (RIs)
    using Real-World Data ('RWD') and methods for comparing and verifying RIs.
    Estimates RIs by applying advanced statistical methods to routine
    diagnostic test measurements, which include both pathological and
    non-pathological samples, to model the distribution of non-pathological
    samples. This distribution is then used to derive reference intervals
    and support RI verification, i.e., deciding if a specific RI is suitable
    for the local population. The package also provides functions for
    printing and plotting algorithm results. See ?refineR for a detailed
    description of features. Version 1.0 of the algorithm is described in
    'Ammer et al. (2021)' <doi:10.1038/s41598-021-95301-2>. Additional
    guidance is in 'Ammer et al. (2023)' <doi:10.1093/jalm/jfac101>. The
    verification method is described in 'Beck et al. (2025)'
    <doi:10.1515/cclm-2025-0728>.
