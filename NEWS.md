# refineR version 1.5.0 

The new version includes the following updates and improvements: 

* More fine-grained search region for lambda (`lambdaVec`)

* Option to use the two-parameter (modified) Box-Cox transformation
  (`findRI(Data = Data, model = "modBoxCox")`)
  
* Update of cost function: new factor to account for measurement imprecision
  in RWD
   
* Adapted definition of region of test results that characterizes the
  non-pathological distribution 
  
* Improved performance for skewed distributions 



# refineR version 1.0.0 

* Initial version put on CRAN 

* Detailed description of the method can be found in Ammer, T.,
